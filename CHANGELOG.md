# Changelog

All notable changes to wiki-smith are recorded here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- The description tells agents to load wiki-smith before writing anything in `.wiki/`, for any wiki request (creating a page or doc too), and adds the triggers "wiki", "create a doc in .wiki" and "cria um doc no .wiki".
- The "Shared files across sessions" pitfall now says how to commit only your own lines of a shared `index.md`, inbox or day index (a blob from `HEAD` plus your lines, `git update-index --cacheinfo`, a direct commit) instead of only warning that the carry takes the whole diff.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- `note.sh` no longer hangs in agent shells and CI. It used to read stdin whenever it was not a TTY, and there stdin is open but never closes. It now reads stdin only with the new `-b` flag.
- `note.sh` leaves exactly one blank line between the title and the body (a later `cat >>` used to produce two); without `-b` the file ends right after the title line, so a paragraph appended with `>>` starts with its own blank line.
- `sync.sh` no longer ships another session's uncommitted lines in the generated day index: the day index is excluded from the carried diff and regenerated in the worktree with `day-index.sh`, so it lists only notes that are in the commit.
- `sync.sh` never discards a local edit that is not upstream when it restores paths after a push (a shared file that differs from what was pushed is kept), and removes only the untracked files it carried.
- When the checkout cannot be fast-forwarded after a successful push (local `<main>` diverged, or overlapping edits), `sync.sh` says why and exits 0 instead of implying a failure.

### Changed

- **Behaviour change:** a body piped into `note.sh` is now ignored unless `-b` is given (`printf '%s\n' "text" | note.sh -b "Title"`).
- `sync.sh` runs `lint.py` on exactly what it will commit, in every mode, and refuses a red lint (exit 1, checkout untouched, carry worktree removed). It also lints again after the rebase, before the push.
- Paths are resolved physically (`pwd -P`), so a symlinked temp directory such as macOS `/var` no longer reads as "outside the repository".

### Added

- `sync.sh -W`: prints a fresh worktree from `origin/<main>` to edit shared files (index, inbox) in; `sync.sh -m ... [-p] PATH...` run from inside it commits there, and with `-p` rebases, pushes, fast-forwards the main checkout where it can and removes the worktree.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- First release: one skill that routes a session to a daily note, a topic-page fix, a map of content with facet pages, or nothing ([SKILL.md](SKILL.md)).
- The full method in English ([references/method.md](references/method.md)) and a per-repo config, `.wiki/wiki.config` ([references/config.md](references/config.md)).
- POSIX `sh` scripts: `note.sh`, `day-index.sh`, `dates.sh`, `sync.sh`; and a stdlib-only `lint.py` with `en` and `pt-BR` output.
- Templates for a page, a map and a note, an example config and a pt-BR preset ([templates/](templates/)).
- Its own memory in [.wiki/](.wiki/README.md), a README, the MIT license ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) and credits ([ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md)).
